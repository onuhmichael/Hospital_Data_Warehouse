# 🏗️ Hospital Data Warehouse Project

This repository documents the development of a Hospital-based Data Warehouse through six well-defined phases—moving from requirements analysis to the production-ready gold layer. Each phase corresponds to a WorkPackage and includes key tasks, diagrams, and development artifacts.

## 🧩 Project Structure & Key Steps

### 📍 WP1 – Requirements Analysis

- Understand business needs and technical constraints
- Document data sources, KPIs, and reporting goals
- Deliverable: Project Requirements Document

### 🧠 WP2 – Design Data Architecture

- Select data management approach (e.g., ELT vs ETL)
- Design data flow layers (Bronze → Silver → Gold)
- Create architectural diagram using Draw.io
- Deliverable: Data Architecture Blueprint

### 🚀 WP3 – Project Initialization

- Create task breakdown and timeline
- Define naming conventions for database, tables, and code
- Set up GitHub repository structure
- Initialize database and schemas
- Deliverable: Repo setup + SQL environment baseline

### 🟫 WP4 – Build Bronze Layer

- Analyze source system formats and ingestion requirements
- Code ingestion processes (e.g., using SQL scripts or orchestration tools)
- Validate schema structure and data completeness
- Document the raw data flow in Draw.io
- Deliverable: Bronze Layer SQL Scripts + Ingestion Flow Diagram

### 🪙 WP5 – Build Silver Layer

- Perform data cleansing, normalization, and enrichment
- Validate business logic and rule consistency
- Extend architecture documentation with integration logic
- Deliverable: Silver Layer ETL Code + Integration Diagrams

### ⭐ WP6 – Build Gold Layer

- Define business objects and analytical entities
- Construct star schema (dimensions & facts)
- Validate data quality and integration integrity
- Document data catalog and final flow diagrams
- Deliverable: Gold Layer SQL Scripts + Data Model + Catalog

## 💡 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/your-org/data-warehouse.git`
2. Set up your local SQL environment (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQL Server)
3. Run schema initialization scripts from `database-scripts/`
4. Follow phase-wise implementation using project folders

## 📌 Notes

- Diagrams are created using [Draw.io](https://draw.io)
- Scripts follow project-wide naming conventions for maintainability
- Each layer builds upon its predecessor—ensure sequence integrity!
